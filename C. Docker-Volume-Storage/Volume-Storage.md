## Docker Volumes and Storage

Docker volumes are persistent storage that can be used by containers to store data outside the container filesystem.

### When to Use Docker Volumes?
Volumes are designed to support the deployment of stateful Docker containers. Youâ€™ll need to use a volume when a container requires persistent storage to permanently save new and modified files.

- Typical volume use cases include the following:

 - Database storage
 - Application data 
 - Essential caches
 - Convenient data backups
 - Share data between containers 
 - Write to remote filesystems 

docker run -it -v demo_volume:/data ubuntu:22.04
docker run -it -d -v /demo_volume1:/data ubuntu:22.04
`docker run -d --name my_app --network my_flask_network -v my_flask_volume:/app my_flask_app`

## [Types of Docker Storage](https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2022/12/22/docker4.aspx)

## Named Volumes:

â–¶ Managed by Docker. Persist across container restarts and removals.\
â–¶ Stored in Docker's default location (/var/lib/docker/volumes).\
â–¶ Can be shared between multiple containers.


## Bind Mounts:

â–¶ Mount a host directory into the container.\
â–¶ Can be used for accessing local files on the host.\
â–¶ Requires absolute path on host machine.\
â–¶ Changes in files are reflected both on host and container.


## tmpfs Mounts:

â–¶ Temporary storage in memory.\
â–¶ Does not persist data after container stop/restart.\
â–¶ Useful for sensitive or ephemeral data.



### ðŸ“ŒExample 1: Running a Nginx Server with tmpfs for Logs

`docker run -d --name nginx_tmpfs --tmpfs /var/log/nginx:rw,size=100M -p 8080:80 nginx`\
`docker exec -it nginx_tmpfs df -h /var/log/nginx`\
`docker exec -it nginx_tmpfs ls -l /var/log/nginx`

### ðŸ“ŒExample 2: PostgreSQL with tmpfs for Temporary Tables
`docker run -d --name postgres_tmpfs --tmpfs /var/lib/postgresql/tmp:rw,size=200M -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret@123 -p 5432:5432 postgres`\
`docker exec -it postgres_tmpfs df -h /var/lib/postgresql/tmp`\
`docker exec -it postgres_tmpfs ls -l /var/lib/postgresql/tmp`


## When to Use:

**Volumes:** For data that needs to persist across container restarts.\
**Bind Mounts:** When you need to access or modify files on the host system.\
**tmpfs:** For temporary or secure data storage that doesnâ€™t need persistence.

**Key Benefits of Volumes:**

Easy backup, restore, and migration.\
Better performance (especially with databases).\
Isolation from container lifecycle.
